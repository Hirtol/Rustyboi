# Rustyboi
This is an attempt at yet another GameBoy (and GameBoy Colour) emulator written in Rust.  
This is not supposed to be anything but a learning experience for both creating something in Rust, 
as well as learning about the GB. For actual emulation purposes
one would best refer to another fully working emulator, e.g [PyBoy](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy).

## Prerequisites
- `cmake` and `gcc` for [SDL2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2)
- Rust 1.47.0

## Installation
### Build from Source
1. `git clone https://github.com/Hirtol/Rustyboi.git`
2. `cd Rustyboi`
3. `cargo build --release`
4. `cd target/release`
5. Execute `rustyboi_sdl.exe` or your OS's equivalent.

### Note
The SDL2 bundled compilation will fail if there are spaces in the path to the
build directory.
