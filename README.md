# Rustyboi
This is an attempt at yet another GameBoy (just DMG for now) emulator written in Rust.  
This is not supposed to be anything but a learning experience for both creating something in Rust, 
as well as learning about the GB. For actual emulation purposes
one would best refer to another fully working emulator, e.g [PyBoy](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy).

## Prerequisites
- [SDL2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2)

## Installation
